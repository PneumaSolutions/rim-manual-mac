# Installation
How you acquire and install Remote Incident Manager depends on your use case and configuration, but in any case the process is quite straight forward.
## Typical Installation for Individuals
There is only one installation package to use, whether you are offering or receiving assistance.
### Zip
1. [Download Remote Incident Manager](https://download.pneumasolutions.com/rim/rimsetup.exe)
1. Go to your downloads folder via Finder (*Option+command+L*). Depending on which browser you used to download RIM, you will either find:
    1. A remote Incident Manager application. If the zip has been already extracted, you may simply copy this application with *command+C*, press *Command+Shift+A* to go to applications, and then paste with *Command+V*.
    1. A Remote Incident Manager zip file that you will need to open with *Command+O* to extract. Once extracted, locate the Remote Incident Manager application, and copy and paste into your applications folder as described above.
<!-- end -->
That's all there is to it - You are all set to run Remote Incident Manager for the first time! Additionally, RIM sets up a multipurpose global hotkey (*Option+Shift+Backspace*) which, among other things, automatically launches the program from wherever you are.  

# Permissions
Due to Mac OS's precautionary behavior when dealing with applications of this nature for the first time, you will need to grant some permissions to Remote Incident Manager upon first launch.
