# Installation
How you acquire and install Remote Incident Manager depends on your use case and configuration, but in any case the process is quite straight forward.
## Typical Installation for Individuals
There is only one installation package to use, whether you are offering or receiving assistance.
1. [Download Remote Incident Manager](https://download.pneumasolutions.com/rim/rimsetup.exe)
1. Go to your downloads folder via Finder (*Option+command+L*). Locate the downloaded .pkg file and open it with *Command+O*.
1. An installation wizard will appear. Follow the onscreen instructions.
<!-- end -->
That's all there is to it - You are all set to run Remote Incident Manager for the first time! You may run it from your applications folder, accessed via *Command+Shift+A* while located in Finder. Additionally, RIM sets up a multipurpose global hotkey (*Option+Shift+Backspace*) which, among other things, automatically launches the program from wherever you are.  

# Permissions
Due to Mac OS's precautionary behavior when dealing with applications of this nature for the first time, you will need to grant some permissions to Remote Incident Manager upon first launch.
